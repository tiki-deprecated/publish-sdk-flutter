# What is data trading?

It is pretty simple, really. You’re agreeing to trade specific types of data with us **in exchange
for** the offered compensation.

It's **100% optional**. Declining to participate will not negatively impact your current experience.

The types of data are specified on the offer screen, and no other data than the explicitly stated
data is traded as part of the program.

Each _“trade”_ is legally binding and takes the form of a data license. By trading the data, you
agree to let us license your data for the explicitly stated reasons found on the offer screen.

<br />

# What is a data license/data licensing?

A data license is a legally binding, immutable contract that contains the exact details and
parameters of the trade. This includes the type of data being traded, the purposes for which the
business can access and use the data, and the duration for which it can be used.

Once created, the license cannot be altered in any way; however, as a user, **you can always change
your mind**. If you no longer want the business to use and/or access the data, your settings can be
toggled off/on any time and the previous license becomes null and void.

If you choose to participate again, a separate, new license is created replacing the previous
license.

<br />

# Why should I trade/license my data?

There are many reasons one may want to trade/license data, including receiving compensation in the
form of:

- discounts
- loyalty points
- access to exclusive features
- and more.

You may also want to receive more accurate advertisements or more personalization and customization
from the chosen business.

Other reasons **include contributing** to academic studies and assisting in improving products and
services.

The **choice is completely up to you**; if the offer isn’t to your liking, simply decline and
access/use is turned off. You can always change your mind later.

The most important thing is understanding how your data is being accessed/used and receiving fair
compensation for it; finally 🥳.
